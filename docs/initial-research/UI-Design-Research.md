Architectural Blueprint and Reference Analysis for a System-Based Reality RPG Application1. Executive Summary and Strategic AlignmentThe concept of a "System-based Reality RPG"—an application that overlays gamified progression mechanics onto real-world human performance—represents a sophisticated convergence of three distinct disciplines: futuristic user interface (FUI) design, behavioral psychology, and real-time distributed systems. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the reference materials, architectural patterns, and design paradigms necessary to construct such an application. The analysis is derived from a comprehensive review of existing platforms, technical frameworks, and community discussions surrounding the Solo Leveling franchise and the broader "Life RPG" genre.The core objective is to identify specific websites, frameworks, and methodologies that serve as the definitive "reference implementation" for this application. The user's query—"which website that can be used as reference for this app"—is deceptively simple. It requires a multi-faceted answer because no single existing website encapsulates the entire scope. The "System" is a composite entity: it requires the visual fidelity of Arwes and ArtStation concepts, the progression logic of Habitica and Darebee, the technical reactivity of Linear and Next.js, and the intelligent oversight of LLM evaluations powered by Opik.This document serves as a foundational technical specification, dissecting these references to provide a roadmap for development. It explores how to translate the "System" from a fictional narrative device into a functional software product, addressing the aesthetic requirements of the "Cyberpunk" genre, the mathematical rigor of XP curves, and the legal complexities of intellectual property.2. Visual Reference Architecture: The FUI ParadigmThe defining characteristic of the "System" is its interface. It is not merely a "dark mode" application; it is a Futuristic User Interface (FUI), often described in design literature as a Heads-Up Display (HUD) or Diegetic UI. The aesthetic is characterized by high information density, neon-on-black contrast, rigid geometric framing, and "mechanical" animation.2.1 The Foundational Framework: ArwesThe primary and most critical reference for the visual implementation of the "System" is Arwes (arwes.dev). While many UI libraries exist (Material UI, Ant Design, Shadcn), Arwes is unique in its dedication to the "Sci-Fi" aesthetic.2.1.1 Conceptual AlignmentArwes defines itself as a "Futuristic Sci-Fi UI Web Framework" influenced by productions like Star Citizen, Halo, and TRON: Legacy. This aligns perfectly with the "System" aesthetic, which demands a look that feels alien yet functional—a construct of magical engineering. The framework's design philosophy treats the UI not as a static page but as a living simulation that "boots up," employing scanning lines, bleeps, and glitches that mimic a holographic projection stabilizing in physical space.2.1.2 Technical Component AnalysisAnalyzing the Arwes documentation and repository structure reveals specific packages that serve as direct references for "System" features :@arwes/react-frames: This package is essential for creating the "System Windows." In the source material, Quest Windows are not simple rectangles; they have cut corners, glowing borders, and technical markings. Arwes frames provide Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) components that resize responsively while maintaining these complex geometric borders. This solves a critical CSS challenge: standard border-radius cannot achieve the "angled cut" look (chamfered corners) inherent to FUI design without complex clip-path manipulation.@arwes/react-bgs: The "System" often appears against a backdrop of a void or a subtle digital grid. This package provides passive UI background effects, such as moving grids or moving dots, which add depth to the "Player Status" screen without distracting from the data.@arwes/react-bleeps: Audio feedback is a core component of the "System." When a player accepts a quest or allocates a stat point, there is an audible mechanical acknowledgement. Arwes includes a sound management system specifically for short, interactive UI sounds, allowing the developer to map "click" and "hover" events to futuristic audio assets.@arwes/react-text: The "System" communicates via text that types itself out character by character, often accompanied by a decoding animation. Arwes provides text effect components that simulate this "data transmission" style, essential for the "Quest Received" modals.2.1.3 Implementation Strategy and LimitationsIt is important to note that Arwes is currently in an alpha state (v1.0.0-alpha.23). While it provides the visual language, it may not be production-ready for complex state management. Therefore, the strategic recommendation is to use Arwes as a reference for the visual primitives—analyzing its source code on GitHub  to understand how to build responsive SVG frames and text deciphering animations—while implementing the core application logic in a more stable framework like Next.js.2.2 Functional Density References: Linear and VercelWhile Arwes provides the "fantasy," the application must remain usable. For this, we look to Linear (linear.app) and Vercel (vercel.com) as references for "High-Performance Dark Mode".2.2.1 The "Linear" Standard for Data DensityThe "Player Status" screen in a System-based app is data-heavy: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Vitality, Mana, HP, XP, and Title must all be visible at a glance. Linear is the industry standard for displaying dense information without clutter.Monospaced Typography: Linear utilizes monospaced fonts for identifiers and data points, a chaotic-neutral design choice that enhances the "technical" feel of the interface. This mirrors the System's presentation of numerical stats.Subtle Gradients and Borders: Instead of solid blocks of color, Linear uses extremely subtle borders (e.g., border-white/10) and gradients to define hierarchy. This creates a "glass-like" feel that is more sophisticated than the stark wireframes of Arwes, offering a bridge between the raw sci-fi aesthetic and modern usability standards.2.2.2 Vercel’s Dashboard GridsVercel’s template library  features "Bento Grid" layouts—rectangular, tessellating grids that organize disparately sized widgets. This is the ideal reference layout for the "Main Dashboard" of the app.Modular Widgets: A Bento Grid allows the "Daily Quest" tracker, the "HP Bar," and the "Weekly Schedule" to coexist on a single screen. Vercel’s use of dark mode dashboards with high-contrast charts (using libraries like VisActor)  demonstrates how to visualize XP growth or Mana regeneration over time in a way that looks professional yet "tech-heavy."2.3 Artistic Direction: ArtStation and DribbbleFor specific art direction regarding the "Solo Leveling" brand identity, ArtStation and Dribbble serve as the primary visual libraries.2.3.1 The "Solo Leveling" UI MotifArtists on ArtStation have deconstructed the specific UI elements of the anime. Key visual markers identified include:The "Blue": A specific, piercing electric blue (#00FFFF to #445EF2) that glows against a deep onyx background (#121212).Floating Modals: The System's windows are not attached to a background; they float in 3D space. This implies the use of heavy box-shadow for glow and backdrop-filter for the glass effect.Typography: The text is sans-serif, tall, and often capitalized, resembling fonts like "Bebas Neue" or "Eurostile Extended."2.3.2 Dribbble Trends: "Crypto" and "Cybersecurity"Search queries for "Sci-Fi HUD" and "Cybersecurity Dashboard" on Dribbble reveal relevant patterns. Interestingly, designs for "Crypto Trading Bots"  often closely resemble the System aesthetic due to their reliance on dark themes, neon green/red data tickers, and real-time graph updates. These serve as excellent references for the "Marketplace" or "Shop" interface of the app.3. Design System Specification: Color, Motion, and GlassBased on the visual references, we can define the technical design system required to build the app. This involves translating the artistic concepts into CSS variables, Tailwind configurations, and animation logic.3.1 The "System Blue" Color PaletteThe color palette is the most immediate identifier of the "System." Analysis of color palette repositories  and Tailwind customization guides  leads to a definitive "System" palette.Table 1: The Reference System Color PaletteUsage ContextColor NameHex Code (Reference)Tailwind/CSS Implementation NoteBackground BaseDeep Void#050505 Use bg-[#050505] or bg-slate-950. Pure black (#000) is often too harsh; a very dark charcoal allows for better shadow depth.Primary InterfaceSystem Cyan#00FFFF The core color for borders and active text. In Tailwind v4, use oklch for higher vibrancy: oklch(0.85 0.2 240).Secondary AccentElectric Blue#3498DB Used for secondary information or inactive states to reduce visual fatigue from pure cyan.Alert / PenaltyDungeon Red#C5003C Used for "Penalty Quests" or low HP warnings. High saturation is critical to induce urgency.Success / BuffNeon Green#00FF9F Used for "Quest Complete" notifications and positive stat changes.Magic / ManaArcane Purple#BD00FF Reserved for Mana points and magical abilities.Text PrimaryWhite Glare#FFFFFFText should be pure white to contrast with the dark background, often with a slight text-shadow to simulate screen luminescence.Tailwind Configuration Strategy:
Using the tailwind.config.js file, these colors should be defined as semantic variables (e.g., colors: { system: { primary: '#00FFFF', alert: '#C5003C' } }). This allows for global theme adjustments if the user wants to switch the "System" color (e.g., from Blue to Red, as seen in the "Job Change" arc).3.2 Glassmorphism and Depth PhysicsThe "System" windows are transparent, yet distinct. This requires a specific implementation of Glassmorphism.The Recipe: References from Glassmorphism Generator  and Tailwind blogs  provide the exact CSS composition:Background: rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.6) (Dark, semi-transparent)Blur: backdrop-filter: blur(12px) (The "frosted" look)Border: border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) (A subtle rim light)Shadow: box-shadow: 0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) (Deep drop shadow to separate the window from reality)Tailwind Utility: bg-gray-900/60 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/10 shadow-2xl.3.3 Mechanical Animation with Framer MotionStatic UI fails to capture the "System" feel; it must be animated. Framer Motion is the standard library for this.Orchestration via Variants: The "System" often reveals information sequentially—Title first, then Description, then Rewards. Framer Motion's variants feature allows a parent container to control the timing of its children.Reference Pattern: Define a container variant with staggerChildren: 0.1. This creates the "typing" or "loading" effect where list items (e.g., Quest Rewards) appear one by one.Spring Physics: To make the windows feel "mechanical" rather than "organic," animations should use type: "spring" with high stiffness and low damping. This makes the windows "snap" into place, mimicking the instantaneous materialization of the System in the anime.4. Gamification Logic References: Mapping Reality to DataThe visual layer is merely a skin; the engine of the application is its gamification logic. We must reference platforms that have successfully mapped human behavior to RPG statistics.4.1 Habitica: The Functional BlueprintHabitica (habitica.com) is the most mature reference for the logic of a Life RPG.Task Categorization: Habitica distinguishes between "Habits" (positive/negative actions with no schedule), "Dailies" (recurring tasks with a 24-hour deadline), and "To-Dos" (one-time tasks).System Application: The "Daily Quest: Strength Training" in Solo Leveling is functionally identical to a "Daily" in Habitica. If not completed by midnight, the user takes damage. This mechanic—HP loss for inaction—is the core psychological hook of the "System".Party Mechanics: Habitica’s "Boss Battles" deal damage to the entire party if one member misses a daily task. This social pressure mechanic  serves as a reference for implementing "Raid" features where users team up to complete fitness goals.4.2 Darebee: Content and Quest DesignWhile Habitica provides the engine, Darebee (darebee.com) provides the content. It is a massive, free resource for "RPG Fitness" programs.Narrative Workouts: Darebee’s "Labyrinth" program  structures fitness as a dungeon crawl. Users must perform specific exercises (e.g., "40 High Knees") to "move" between rooms.Reference Value: This is a direct content reference for the "Dungeon" feature of the app. Instead of a generic "Workout List," the app should structure fitness routines as "floors" in a dungeon, where clearing a floor requires a set of exercises derived from Darebee’s verified routines.Visual Manuals: Darebee’s illustrations are clean, distinct, and instruction-heavy, providing a reference for how to display exercise forms within the System’s UI.4.3 Mathematical Models: The XP Progression CurveA critical failure point for gamified apps is the "Leveling Curve." If it is too fast, users get bored; too slow, and they quit. Research into RPG formulas  provides mathematical models to solve this.4.3.1 Comparative Analysis of XP CurvesWe must choose between Polynomial (steady) and Exponential (steep) curves.The Disgaea/Pokemon Model (Polynomial):Formula: $XP = 0.04n^3 + 0.8n^2 + 2n$.Characteristics: This creates a "Cubic" curve. It starts slow but remains manageable. It encourages long-term play without hitting a mathematical wall.The Traditional RPG Model (Exponential):Formula: $XP = \text{Base} \times 2^{(n/10)}$.Characteristics: This doubles the requirement every 10 levels. This mimics the "Solo Leveling" narrative where becoming a high-rank hunter is exponentially harder than a low-rank one.4.3.2 Recommended Formula for Human FitnessUnlike a video game character, a human body has physical limits. An exponential curve is discouraging because human strength does not grow exponentially. Therefore, a Quadratic or Cubic Curve is the appropriate reference.Proposed System Formula:$$XP_{req} = \text{Base} \times (\text{Level})^{2.2}$$Table 2: Projected Leveling TimelineLevelXP Required (Approx)Real-World Effort EquivalentLogic Reference11001 Day of TasksBase value established in snippets 10~15,0001 Month of ConsistencyScaling begins 25~115,0006 Months of ConsistencyThe "Grind" phase 50~550,0002 Years of Consistency"National Level Hunter" Status This curve allows for rapid early gratification (hooking the user) while respecting the reality that elite fitness takes years to achieve.5. Technical Infrastructure: The "Real-Time" StackTo build the "System," the technology stack must support real-time updates (health, mana, notifications) and high-performance rendering. The reference stack identified is Next.js, Supabase, and Opik.5.1 Frontend Architecture: Next.js 14 and React Server ComponentsNext.js (nextjs.org) is the reference framework for modern React applications.Server Actions for "Instant" Feedback: The System must feel responsive. Next.js Server Actions allow the app to mutate data (e.g., "Complete Quest") directly from the UI without the latency of a traditional REST API round-trip. This creates the "snappy" feel of a diegetic interface.Architectural Anti-Patterns: A critical warning from the research  is the misuse of use client. For the "System," high-frequency updates (like a mana regeneration counter) must be isolated in small Client Components (leaves of the render tree) to prevent re-rendering the entire layout. The "Status Window" should be a Server Component that streams in data, while the "HP Bar" is a Client Component.5.2 Backend Real-Time Database: SupabaseSupabase (supabase.com) is the reference for the backend due to its Realtime capabilities.Live Updates: The "System" often interrupts the user with "Emergency Quests." Supabase’s Realtime subscriptions allow the server to push these events to the client instantly. If an admin (or the AI) triggers an event, the player's screen flashes red immediately without a page refresh.Row Level Security (RLS) - Critical Risk: Research highlights a common pitfall in Next.js + Supabase integrations: auth.uid() returning null in Server Components if cookies are not handled correctly.Solution Reference: The application must utilize the @supabase/ssr package to manage session cookies securely across the boundary of Server Actions and Client Components. Strict RLS policies are mandatory: CREATE POLICY "User View Own Stats" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);. This ensures that players cannot "hack" the System to see other players' hidden stats.5.3 Artificial Intelligence: The "System" Persona with OpikThe "System" is a character itself—cold, robotic, and demanding. To replicate this, the app requires an LLM (Large Language Model) integration monitored by Opik (comet.com/opik).5.3.1 LLM Integration StrategyThe app should use an LLM (e.g., Llama 3 via Groq for speed) to:Generate Dynamic Quests: Instead of static text, the AI generates quest descriptions based on the user's recent activity (e.g., "The System detects lethargy. Run 5km.").Evaluate User Logs: Users can input "I swam for 30 minutes." The AI judges if this meets the quest criteria.5.3.2 Evaluation and Monitoring with OpikOpik provides the infrastructure to ensure the AI behaves like the "System" and not a helpful assistant.LLM-as-a-Judge: We can define a custom metric in Opik to grade the AI's responses for "Tone." The tone must be "Imperative, Cold, Robotic."Code Reference :TypeScriptimport { Opik } from "opik";
import { Hallucination, BaseMetric } from "opik/evaluation";

// Custom Metric for "System Tone"
class SystemToneMetric extends BaseMetric {
    constructor() { super("System Tone Alignment"); }
    async score(input, output) {
        // Logic to check if output uses "System" terminology
        const hasSystemKeywords = output.includes("Player") |

| output.includes("Quest");return hasSystemKeywords? 1.0 : 0.0;}}```Tracing: Opik traces every interaction. If the AI starts hallucinating fake quests or giving out too much XP, the developer can trace the exact prompt chain in Opik's dashboard and correct the prompt engineering.6. Intellectual Property and Legal FrameworkDeveloping a "Solo Leveling" inspired app carries significant legal risk. The brand is owned by D&C Media and heavily licensed (e.g., Netmarble's game Solo Leveling: Arise).6.1 Copyright and Trademark RisksAsset Usage: Using specific images of Sung Jin-Woo, the exact "System" window graphics from the anime, or audio clips is a direct copyright violation. Platforms like Roblox and YouTube actively strike this content.Terminology: While "Level Up" and "Dungeon" are generic gaming terms, specific proper nouns like "Sung Jin-Woo," "Igris," "Shadow Monarch," and "National Level Hunter" are likely protected trademarks or copyrightable script elements.6.2 Mitigation and "Fair Use" Strategy"Inspired By" Status: The application must be positioned as a generic "System" or "Life RPG" app, not a "Solo Leveling" app.Original Assets: The developer must create original vector assets (referencing Arwes) rather than ripping assets from the show. The "Blue Neon" aesthetic is a genre trope (Cyberpunk/FUI) and cannot be copyrighted, but the specific drawing of the System window can be.Fan Projects: If the project is non-commercial and open-source (e.g., a GitHub repository like ramxcodes/solo-leveling ), it may exist in a grey area, but app store distribution requires strict adherence to IP laws. The recommendation is to use the aesthetic and mechanics but strip all specific lore.7. Implementation Roadmap and ConclusionTo realize the "System," the developer must execute a roadmap that synthesizes these diverse references.Phase 1: The Visual Foundation (Arwes & Tailwind)Initialize a Next.js 14 project.Install @arwes/react-frames and @arwes/react-text.Configure tailwind.config.js with the "System Blue" palette (#00FFFF, #121212).Build the "Status Window" component using Glassmorphism CSS and Arwes frames.Phase 2: The Logic Engine (Supabase & Math)Set up Supabase with tables for users, quests, and stats.Implement the Quadratic XP Curve ($XP \propto Level^{2.2}$).Implement RLS policies using @supabase/ssr.Phase 3: The Intelligence Layer (Opik)Integrate an LLM (Groq/Llama 3).Set up Opik to trace quest generation.Implement "System Tone" evaluation metrics to ensure immersion.Phase 4: Content Population (Darebee)Scrape/Adapt workout routines from Darebee.Format them into "Dungeon" data structures (e.g., Floor 1 = 10 Pushups).Conclusion:There is no single website that serves as a perfect reference. The "System" is a composite ideal. Arwes provides the skin, Habitica provides the skeleton, Supabase provides the nervous system, and Opik provides the brain. By integrating these four distinct pillars, a developer can construct a reality-bending application that genuinely captures the fantasy of "leveling up" in real life.
