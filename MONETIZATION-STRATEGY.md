## 2. ADVERTISING STRATEGY

### 2.1 Ad Placement Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Non-intrusive, relevant, value-added advertising

**Ad Types:**
1. **Native Feed Ads** - Blended with Hunter Network content
2. **Sponsored Quests** - Featured workouts/recommendations
3. **Video Pre-Rolls** - Before watching workout videos
4. **Banner Ads** - On dashboard and leaderboards
5. **Interstitial Ads** - Between quest completions (max 1/hour)

### 2.2 Native Feed Ads (Primary Revenue Driver)

**Placement:** Hunter Network feed between user-generated content

**Format:**
```
[User Post 1]
[User Post 2]
[SPONSORED AD] - Fitness app ad
├── Image/Video (16:9)
├── Sponsored badge (clearly marked)
├── Engagement buttons (like, comment, share)
└── "Learn More" CTA
[User Post 3]
[User Post 4]
```

**Ad Frequency:**
- Free Users: 1 ad every 4 posts (20% of feed)
- Pro Users: 0 ads
- Max Users: 0 ads

**Ad Performance Metrics:**
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): 1-3% (industry avg: 0.5-1%)
- Engagement Rate: 5-8% (industry avg: 2-5%)
- Viewability: 95%+ (native ads perform better)

**Expected CPM (Cost Per Mille - Cost per 1,000 impressions):**
- Fitness/Health ads: $8-15 CPM
- Gaming/Anime ads: $5-10 CPM
- Average weighted: $10 CPM

**Revenue Calculation:**
- 1,000 users × 50 feed views/month = 50,000 feed views/month
- 20% ads × 50,000 = 10,000 ad impressions
- $10 CPM × 10 = **$100/month** (from feed ads at 1,000 users)

### 2.3 Sponsored Quests

**Placement:** Featured in Quest generation interface and dashboard

**Format:**
```
Today's Featured Quests:
├── [SPONSORED] "Nike Training Club HIIT"
│   ├── Duration: 20 min
│   ├── Difficulty: Medium
│   ├── Equipment: Bodyweight
│   └── "Try Quest" button
├── AI Quest #1 (regular)
├── AI Quest #2 (regular)
└── [SPONSORED] "Peloton Cycling Class"
    ├── Duration: 30 min
    ├── Difficulty: Hard
    └── "Try Quest" button
```

**Frequency:**
- 1-2 sponsored quests/day on dashboard
- Maximum 20% of visible quests
- Clearly marked as "SPONSORED"

**Pricing Model:**
- Cost Per Quest Start (CPQ): $0.50-2.00
- Performance-based: Pay only for completed quests
- Premium placement: $5,000/month (top position)

**Revenue Potential:**
- 1,000 users × 1 quest/day = 30,000 quest starts/month
- 20% sponsored = 6,000 sponsored quest starts
- $1.00 CPQ × 6,000 = **$6,000/month** (conservative estimate)
- Note: This is HIGHLY dependent on brand partnerships

### 2.4 Video Pre-Roll Ads

**Placement:** Before watching workout videos on Hunter Network

**Format:**
```
[Video Player]
├── [AD: 15-30 seconds] - Fitness supplement ad
├── "Skip Ad in 5 seconds" button
└── Your video starts after ad
```

**Frequency:**
- Free Users: 1 ad per video watched
- Pro Users: 0 ads
- Max Users: 0 ads

**Video Ad Rates:**
- 15-second skippable: $8-12 CPM
- 30-second non-skippable: $15-25 CPM
- Average: $15 CPM

**Revenue Calculation:**
- 1,000 users × 10 videos watched/month = 10,000 video views
- $15 CPM × 10 = **$150/month** (from video pre-rolls at 1,000 users)

### 2.5 Banner Ads

**Placement:** Dashboard, leaderboards, quest screens

**Formats:**
- Leaderboard (728x90) - Bottom of leaderboard
- Dashboard (320x50) - Below stats summary
- Quest Screen (300x250) - Below quest details

**Frequency:**
- Static placement (not frequency-capped)
- Refreshed on page load
- Free users see all banners
- Pro/Max users see minimal banners (non-intrusive)

**Banner Ad Rates:**
- Leaderboard: $2-4 CPM
- Dashboard: $3-5 CPM
- Quest Screen: $2-3 CPM
- Average: $3 CPM

**Revenue Calculation:**
- 1,000 users × 30 page views/month = 30,000 impressions
- $3 CPM × 30 = **$90/month** (from banner ads at 1,000 users)

### 2.6 Interstitial Ads

**Placement:** Between quest completions (transition screens)

**Format:**
```
Quest Completed! 🎉
You earned: 150 XP
Level: 12 → 13

[AD: Full-screen overlay]
├── Fitness equipment sale
├── "Shop Now" button
└── "Skip" button (appears after 5s)

[Continue to Next Quest]
```

**Frequency:**
- Maximum 1 ad per hour
- Only after quest completion (positive reinforcement)
- Not during active workouts (interrupts flow)

**Interstitial Ad Rates:**
- Full-screen interstitial: $15-25 CPM
- Average: $20 CPM

**Revenue Calculation:**
- 1,000 users × 5 quests/day = 150,000 quests/month
- 1 ad/hour = 3 ads/day max per user
- Assume 1 ad/3 quests = 50,000 interstitials/month
- $20 CPM × 50 = **$1,000/month** (from interstitials at 1,000 users)
