# 🏛️ PROJECT CONTEXT: "The System: AI Hunter Gym"

## 🎯 Vision & Core Concept
**"The System"** is a gamified fitness application inspired by the *Solo Leveling* manhwa. It transforms the mundane task of working out into a high-stakes RPG adventure.
- **Tagline:** "Your Daily Quest to become S-Rank."
- **Goal:** Users perform daily fitness quests to gain XP, level up, and unlock classes based on real-world effort.
- **Unique Selling Point (USP):** Using **Opik AI** not just for code tracing, but as a living **"System Judge"** that evaluates user effort, calculates dynamic XP, and detects cheating.

---

## 🧠 The "System" Logic (Opik Integration)
Unlike traditional apps that use static XP (e.g., 1 pushup = 10 XP), **The System** uses **LLM-as-a-Judge** to evaluate performance qualitatively.

### 1. The Judge Agent (Opik)
- **Role:** The "Game Master".
- **Input:** User's Level, Class, Daily Quest Target, and User's Completion Log (Text/Voice).
- **Evaluation Logic:**
    - *Scenario:* User reports "Did 20 pushups, form was shaky at the end."
    - *Evaluation:* "User showed High Effort. Technique Low. Target Met."
    - *Output:* **Dynamic XP** (Base Reward + Effort Bonus).
- **Anti-Cheat System:**
    - The Judge analyzes logs for physical impossibility (e.g., "1000 pushups in 1 minute").
    - **Action:** Flag suspicious activity, annul XP, or issue a "Red Flag".

### 2. The Architect Agent (Planner)
- **Role:** The "Quest Giver".
- **Logic:** Generates workouts based on:
    - **Inventory:** (Gym/Home/Park/No Equipment).
    - **Condition:** (Sore/Fresh/Injured).
    - **Time Investment:** (e.g., "I only have 15 mins").
- **Persona:** Cold, Objective, Authoritative.

## 🎮 Game Mechanics & Progression

### 1. Class System (The "Build")
Users select a class that dictates their workout style. This is injected into the Architect's System Prompt:
- **Novice (Base Builder):**
    - *Goal:* Consistency & Form.
    - *Logic:* Low penalty, XP gained from streaks.
- **Ranger/Striker (Intermediate):**
    - *Goal:* Endurance & Speed (Pick up the pace).
    - *Logic:* High volume, short rest periods.
- **Tank/Berserker (Bulking):**
    - *Goal:* Hypertrophy & Strength.
    - *Logic:* Low reps, heavy load (or difficult bodyweight variations).
- **Assassin (Cutting):**
    - *Goal:* Fat Loss & Agility.
    - *Logic:* HIIT, Cardio, High Reps, Calorie burn focus.

### 2. The User Loop
1.  **The Awakening (Onboarding):**
    - User inputs Critical Data (Height, Weight).
    - **Placement Test:** Input max pushups/run capability.
    - **Result:** System assigns Initial Rank (E-Rank to S-Rank).
2.  **Daily Check-In:**
    - User inputs Time Available & Physical Status.
    - System generates a specific **Daily Quest**.
3.  **The Grind (Execution):**
    - User performs the quest.
    - User submits a report.
4.  **Judgment:** Opik evaluates report -> Awards XP -> Updates Stats.
5.  **Level Up:**
    - Exponential XP curve.
    - Level Up triggers Rank Up (E -> D -> C...).

### 3. Gamification Elements
- **Status Window:** Hexagon chart displaying Strength, Agility, Stamina.
- **Leaderboard:** Resets every "Season" (e.g., Monthly) to keep it fair for new users.
- **Penalty Zone:** If a user skips a workout without a valid "Rest" reason, the System issues a "Penalty Quest" (e.g., Run 3km) to maintain their streak.
- **Potions (Nutrition):** MVP approach. Simple advice like "Drink Protein Potion" (Bulking) or "Avoid Sugar Potion" (Cutting).

## 🛠️ Execution Strategy (Hackathon MVP)

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS (Dark Mode, Neon Blue `#2563eb`, Glassmorphism).
- **Backend:** Express/Next.js Server Actions.
- **AI/Ops:** Groq (Generation) + **Opik SDK** (Evaluation/Tracing).

### Roadmap (Feb 1 - Feb 8)
- **Day 1-2 (Logic Core):**
    - Build Planner Agent (Groq).
    - Implement Dynamic XP Logic (Opik Judge).
    - Setup Database Schema.
- **Day 3-4 (UI/UX):**
    - "Solo Leveling" Aesthetics (Blue Boxes, Status Window).
    - Class Selection Screen.
    - "Quest Complete" Card for social sharing (`html-to-image`).
- **Day 5 (Integration):**
    - Connect Frontend to Opik Judge.
    - Implement "Anti-Cheat" flags.
- **Day 6 (Demo Prep):**
    - Record "Novice" to "Assassin" progression.
    - Showcase Opik Dashboard traces (Safety Score & Cheat Detection).

*This context defines the soul of the project. All code and logic must align with the "System" persona: Efficient, Gamified, and Fair.*
