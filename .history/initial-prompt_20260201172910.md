I am building a gamified fitness AI application called "The System" for a hackathon (1-week deadline).
**Core Concept:** A fitness RPG inspired by "Solo Leveling" (Manhwa) aesthetics, but **legally distinct** to avoid copyright issues.
**Tech Stack:**
- **IDE:** Google Antigravity (Cloud IDE) using **OpenCode** (AI Assistant).
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.
- **Backend/DB:** Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Realtime).
- **AI Engine:** **Groq** (Llama-3-70b) for instant workout generation.
- **AI Ops:** Opik (for tracing & evaluating the workout planner agent).

I have prepared some **Draft Architectures** (attached at the bottom). Please perform a Deep Research to **Review, Optimize, and Complete** my plan into a "Project Blueprint for OpenCode Execution".

Focus on these 5 Strategic Pillars:

### 1. "Legally Distinct" Branding & Design System
- **IP Safety:** Research how to capture the "Solo Leveling" vibe (Blue Screens, Floating UI, Ranks E-S) *without* infringing copyright. Suggest a unique name for the app (e.g., "Hunter's System", "Ascension Protocol").
- **Tailwind Config:** Provide a `tailwind.config.ts` extension with a "Systematic & Cold" palette (Neon Blue `#2563eb`, Success Teal `#14b8a6`, Dark Hexagons).
- **UI Components:** Provide Framer Motion variants for "Quest Cards" (Glassmorphism, entrance animations) and a guide for typography suitable for shadcn/ui.

### 2. Gamification Logic & Database Architecture
- **Exponential Leveling Curve:** Create a math formula where leveling gets harder over time (e.g., Level 1 needs 100 XP, Level 100 needs 100,000 XP).
- **Relative Effort Scoring (The "Fairness" Logic):**
  - Create logic where XP is awarded based on *User Class* and *Effort*, not just reps.
  - *Example:* A "Newbie" doing 10 pushups = 100 XP. A "Tank Class" doing heavy Smith Machine Squats = 1500 XP.
- **Database Schema:** Optimize my `DB_SCHEMA_DRAFT` (below) to include **Rank-Based Leaderboards** (Separate views for E-Rank vs S-Rank) using Supabase Views.
- **SQL Script:** Generate the raw SQL setup script for Supabase.

### 3. AI Agent Prompts (Groq + Opik Integration)
- **"The Architect" (Planner Agent):**
  - System Prompt optimized for **Groq (Llama-3)** to output a **Strict JSON Array** of exercises.
  - Must respect the API Contract draft below.
  - Persona: "The System" (Cold, objective, authoritative).
- **"The Judge" (Opik Evaluator):**
  - Javascript/TypeScript evaluation script using **Opik SDK**.
  - **Logic:** Validate if the workout log matches the User's Class (Bulking/Cutting).
  - **Anti-Cheat:** Detect humanly impossible stats (e.g., 1000 reps in 1 min) and flag them.
  - **XP Calculation:** Calculate the final XP reward based on the "Relative Effort" formula from Pillar 2.

### 4. Master Context for OpenCode (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`)
- Refine my attached `PROJECT_CONTEXT` draft.
- Ensure it enforces: "Use Server Actions," "Strict TypeScript," "Groq SDK wrapped in Opik Traces," and "Error handling with toast notifications."

### 5. Execution Strategy (`requirements.md`)
- Write a highly detailed `requirements.md` optimized for OpenCode.
- **Structure by Phases:**
  - *Phase 1:* Database Schema & Auth Setup.
  - *Phase 2:* Layout, Onboarding Flow & Class Selection.
  - *Phase 3:* Groq API Integration & Quest Generation.
  - *Phase 4:* Opik Evaluation Logic & XP System.
  - *Phase 5:* Leaderboard & Social Sharing.

```typescript
interface WorkoutPlan {
  quest_name: string; // e.g. "Survival Protocol: Leg Day"
  rank_difficulty: "E" | "D" | "C" | "B" | "A" | "S";
  estimated_duration_min: number;
  exercises: {
    name: string;
    sets: number;
    reps: string; // "12-15" or "Failure"
    rest_sec: number;
    tips: string;
  }[];
