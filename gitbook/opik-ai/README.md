## What is OPIK AI?

OPIK AI is our **LLM-as-a-Judge** technology that evaluates every quest completion with complete transparency. Every XP reward is calculated based on objective multi-factor evaluation that you can trace and verify.

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Fair Evaluation**
- Multi-factor scoring ensures XP reflects actual effort
- No bias - every hunter is evaluated by the same criteria
- Consistent scoring across all ranks and classes

### 2. **Complete Transparency**
- View your complete evaluation trace
- See exactly how your XP was calculated
- Understand what you can improve

### 3. **Privacy-First**
- We track quest metrics, not personal data
- Your conversations and biometrics are never traced
- Opt-out option available anytime

## Three-Factor Evaluation

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Form Quality** | 40% | Exercise technique from proof |
| **Effort Level** | 30% | Consistency and intensity during workout |
| **Consistency** | 30% | Comparison to your historical performance |

## XP Multiplier System

| Overall Score | Grade | XP Multiplier | Description |
|---------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 0.90 - 1.00 | S | 1.5x | Excellent performance |
| 0.80 - 0.89 | A | 1.3x | Great performance |
| 0.70 - 0.79 | B | 1.1x | Good performance |
| 0.60 - 0.69 | C | 1.0x | Average performance |
| 0.50 - 0.59 | D | 0.9x | Below average |
| 0.00 - 0.49 | E | 0.8x | Poor performance |
