## Core Features

### OPIK AI Evaluation

Multi-factor evaluation (form 40%, effort 30%, consistency 30%) determines XP multipliers (0.8x-1.5x). Every evaluation is traced and viewable by users.

### AI Quest Generation

Groq LLM (Llama 3.3 70B) generates unique workouts tailored to rank (E-S), class (Tank/Striker/Assassin), equipment, and goals.

### Anti-Cheat System

Proof uploads required for XP. Time anomaly detection prevents fast completions. OPIK AI moderates community reports.

### Social Network

Hunter Network feed shows completions. Kudos and respects system. Global, rank-specific, and class-specific leaderboards.
