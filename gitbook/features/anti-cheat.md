# Anti-Cheat

ASCEND's multi-layered approach to ensure fair gameplay.

## Anti-Cheat Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| **Proof Upload** | Verifies quest completion |
| **Time Anomaly Detection** | Catches unrealistically fast completions |
| **OPIK AI Evaluation** | Scores actual effort |
| **Community Reporting** | Peer review system |
| **Manual Review** | Suspicious activity flagged |

## Proof Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Minimum duration | 30 seconds |
| Video quality | Clear, well-lit |
| Content | User performing exercises |
| Timestamp | Must match completion time |

## Time Anomaly Detection

Quest completion time is compared to expected range:

| Rank | Quest Duration | Expected Time | Threshold |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| E | 15-30 min | 15-30 min | < 50% flagged |
| D | 20-45 min | 20-45 min | < 50% flagged |
| C | 25-60 min | 25-60 min | < 50% flagged |
| B | 30-75 min | 30-75 min | < 50% flagged |
| A | 35-90 min | 35-90 min | < 50% flagged |
| S | 45-90 min | 45-90 min | < 50% flagged |

**Flagged completions** are reviewed by OPIK AI for authenticity.

## OPIK AI Moderation

Users can report suspicious completions:

| Report Type | Action |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Fake proof | Video/image review |
| Unusual time | Time anomaly check |
| Inconsistent effort | Score analysis |

### Moderation Process

1. Report received
2. OPIK AI analyzes proof
3. Score recalculated if suspicious
4. XP adjusted accordingly
5. Repeat offenders: temporary ban

## Penalties

| Violation | First Offense | Repeat |
| --------- | ------------- | ------ |
| Fake proof | XP deducted | 1-day ban |
| Time anomaly | Score reduced | 3-day ban |
| Multiple reports | Warning | 7-day ban |
| Exploiting | 30-day ban | Permanent |

## Prevention Tips for Users

| Tip | Reason |
| --- | ------ |
| Complete workouts honestly | Fair evaluation |
| Upload clear proof | Avoid false flags |
| Take reasonable time | Don't rush |
| Follow exercise instructions | Better scores |
