## Quest System

AI generates personalized quests. Users track sets, reps, and weights during workout. Upload proof (photo/video) required for XP. Quests include warm-up, main exercises, and cool-down.

## Anti-Cheat

Proof uploads mandatory for all XP rewards. Time anomaly detection flags suspiciously fast completions (<70% expected duration). OPIK AI evaluates form, effort, and consistency to detect low effort. Community reports allow users to flag suspicious activity.

## Gamification

XP rewards: 50-4,000 base XP based on quest difficulty. OPIK AI applies 0.8x-1.5x multiplier based on performance. Level up at XP thresholds. Rank up from E to S. Achievements and streaks tracked.

## Social Features

Hunter Network feed shows quest completions from all users. Give kudos (1x) or respects (5x). Leaderboards: global, rank-specific, class-specific. Time filters: daily, weekly, monthly, all-time. Send friend requests, view profiles, follow progress.

## Class System

Choose hunter class: Tank (strength), Striker (speed), or Assassin (agility). Quests adapt to class specialization with different exercise emphasis and rep ranges.
